**Natturu** have a loose control over one of the five elements, though it is mere legend for a human to control more than one at a time. Those who influence the Wind are sought after and treated with respect. Natturu who call upon the powers of Earth, Water, or Fire tend to be more independent. Void natturu are the stuff of myths, and if they exist do not mix with urban folk. Elemental affinity is innate, but there are clearly defined training regimens to harness and build the abilities which emerge in adolescents. Because of the utility of natturu, particularly wind, they are sought out as soon as a power is evident. As such, it is one of the few times when lowlanders ascend to island status.

It is believed that some wizards derive power through communion with evil gods and spirits.
