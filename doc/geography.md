## Geography and Environment

The environment is arid. Deserts separate many areas. Oases dot the land, many accessible only to those who know how to find them.

### Islands

Of particular note are the "islands". Most of them are inhabited, unless their terrain is too rough to settle on. The islands appear as if patches of land uprooted from the earth below and suspended in the sky. The size of an island can range from just a few hundred square meters to massive, multi-level cities. Some islands are closer to the ground, ten to fifteen meters above the level of the ground below, while others are as high as 150 meters.

Most islands collect rainwater efficiently, but are not particularly suited to agriculture beyond the size of a garden. Herding of goats and sheep is common on the islands; the animals are well suited to the precarious edges of many islands.

### The Shadows

Areas which fall in the daily shadow of an island are referred to as "the shadows". These areas tend to be fertile and well suited to larger scale agriculture.

### Eldur Waste

Most of the known islands circle an expanse know as the Eldur Waste. This desert is uncrossable to human traffic, whether on foot on by air.
