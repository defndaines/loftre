## Technology

People of Loftre have primitive technology available to them compared to our world. At best, they have items available which were discovered during our Dark Ages.

Because of the importance of air-bound shipping, armor and weapons tend to favor speed and light weight. Plate mail is unheard of, as are weapons which evolved to deal with plate mail. Only city guards would wear heavy armor.

Loftskip travel must defer to the winds, and as such trade moves in one direction when by air. This is called the "great circle" - a trade route which flows counter-clockwise around the Eldur Waste. The price of goods is dictated by how far it has to travel around the circle, such that goods from the "next" city can be expensive simply because they must travel the entire circle.
