There is a sharp distinction between the **island-born** and the **lowlanders**.

The term "island-born" is generally applied to anyone born in the cities, whether laborers, merchants, or artisans.

The term "lowlander" applies to three groups of people. First, to the farmers who grow crops in the shadows of the cities. A second group consists of nomadic peoples, who may live outside the agricultural regions tied to the cities or actively participate in land-bound trade. Third, there are small towns scattered here and there in isolation, usually focused on some activity like mining or settled around a year-round oasis.
