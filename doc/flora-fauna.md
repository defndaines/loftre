## Flora and Fauna

Loftre has natural plants and animals typical of arid regions.

Loftwood is an indispensable resource for the islands. This tree grows on the shady side of mountains, growing strong and tall. When cut, loftwood has a buoyancy which allows it to float in air. Its harvesting is the exclusive domain of shipbuilders, who assemble the loftskip that travel the winds between islands.

Supernatural creatures are not mere legends, though most urban areas are free of their menace. Travel between cities, however, faces the peril of numerous creatures imbued with magical or unnatural powers.
